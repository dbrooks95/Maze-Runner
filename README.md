# Pathfinder Assignment

> For this class assignment, we were given a file with an arbitrary maze and maze runner placed somewhere on the path. We were tasked with using a solution to find every possible path to a exit which is also arbitrarily placed. The goal of this assignment was to get practice implementing a good backtracking solution.

## The Magic

```bash
# Compile this program with one of the test cases via cmd line
javac TestCase01.java Pathfinder.java
